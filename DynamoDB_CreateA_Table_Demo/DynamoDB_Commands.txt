1) After running AWS Configure, create a DynamoDB table using the following command:

aws dynamodb create-table --table-name ProductCatalog --attribute-definitions \
AttributeName=Id,AttributeType=N --key-schema \
AttributeName=Id,KeyType=HASH \
--provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5


2) This is the command to populate the table:
**** (make sure items.json is located in your working directory) ****

aws dynamodb batch-write-item --request-items file://items.json

3) This is the command to query Dynamodb from EC2 command line - make sure the region is correct. You shoud be working in us-east-1.

aws dynamodb get-item --table-name ProductCatalog --region us-east-1  --key '{"Id":{"N":"403"}}'


sle notes:

Know the basic commands
That the use needs the correct IAM for each command
The API is the 'aws dynamodb', for example the aws dynamodb put-item command

You configure a table as to how performant you want it. And are charged accordingly?
This is called 'Provisioned Throughput'!!!
There is also 'On Demand' where aws scales up or down depending on workload.

Above it is 5 read and 5 write
Which is 5*4 = 20 kb per second read (strongly consistant)
Which is 5*8 = 40 kb per second read (eventually consistant)
which is 5*1 = 5 kb per second write

Reads eventually consistant: -

 Divide the size of each unit (record) by 4kb and round up.
 Multiply the value by the number of records required (Provisioned Throughput) per second 

Reads eventually consistant:-

As above x 2

Writes: -

 Divide the size of each unit (record) by 1kb and round up.
 Multiply the value by the number of records required (Provisioned Throughput) per second
